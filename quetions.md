## Response:
Absolutely! Here’s an elaborated version of your questions for an L3 (advanced) OpenShift support client meeting. I’ll add **context**, **clarifying sub-questions**, and **why** you ask each one. This way, you can ask confidently and get detailed info from the client.

* * *

### **1\. General Setup**

*   **Which OpenShift version are you using?**  
    _This helps us understand the platform capabilities, compatibility with APIs, and supported features. For example, OpenShift 4.x has many differences compared to OpenShift 3.x._
*   **Where is OpenShift running – on cloud or on-premises?**  
    _We want to know if you are using OpenShift on a public cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) or your own data center. This will help us plan for integrations, storage, and networking needs._
*   **How many clusters and nodes are currently deployed?**  
    _This gives us an idea about the scale of your environment, resource allocation, and how workloads are distributed._


* * *

Would you like me to **add 5-7 more well-framed advanced L3-level questions** (e.g., about storage, monitoring, networking, and security) that you can ask the client?

1\. **Images & Builds**
-----------------------

*   **Where do you store your container images?**
    *   _Possible options:_ OpenShift internal registry, Docker Hub, Quay.io, AWS ECR, or any other external/private registries?
    *   **Why:** Knowing this helps understand image security, network policies, and troubleshooting failed pulls.
*   **How are your container images built and pushed to your registry?**
    *   _Possible methods:_ Using Source-to-Image (S2I), Jenkins pipelines, Tekton, external CI/CD tools, or something else?
    *   _Follow-up:_ Are there automated build triggers on code commit, or are builds manually triggered?
    *   **Why:** This reveals the automation level and potential integration points for troubleshooting image-related issues.

* * *

2\. **Nodes & Resources**
-------------------------

*   **How do you handle node scaling within your OpenShift cluster?**
    *   _Options:_ Autoscaling (cluster autoscaler), manual scaling, cloud-provider autoscaling (like AWS/GCP/Azure)?
    *   _Follow-up:_ Is there a minimum/maximum node count? Any scheduled scaling?
    *   **Why:** Important for understanding resource availability and preventing outages during high load.
*   **Are there any special node labels, taints, or tolerations applied?**
    *   _Examples:_ Dedicated nodes for databases, logging, monitoring, GPU workloads, or infra components?
    *   _Follow-up:_ Are there any “NoSchedule” taints or anti-affinity rules we need to be aware of?
    *   **Why:** Impacts troubleshooting of pod placement issues and performance optimization.

* * *

3\. **Storage & Persistence**
-----------------------------

*   **Do you use dynamic provisioning or static persistent volumes (PVs) for storage?**
    *   _If yes to dynamic:_ Which CSI drivers are you using (e.g., AWS EBS, Azure Disk, NFS, GlusterFS)?
    *   _If static:_ How are PVs managed and mapped to workloads?
    *   **Why:** To assess flexibility, reliability, and support for storage growth.
*   **Have you noticed any issues or performance bottlenecks with your storage solution?**
    *   _Examples:_ Slow PVC binding, high I/O latency, stuck pods waiting for volumes, etc.
    *   **Why:** Storage issues can lead to downtime or degraded performance, especially for stateful apps.

* * *

4\. **Networking & Routes**
---------------------------

*   **Are you using OpenShift Routes or standard Kubernetes Ingress for exposing services?**
    *   _Follow-up:_ Any custom routers (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy) in use?
    *   **Why:** Impacts how external traffic is routed and troubleshooting connectivity issues.
*   **How is ingress traffic secured with TLS certificates?**
    *   _Methods:_ Cert-Manager, OpenShift built-in certs, external provider, or manual management?
    *   _Follow-up:_ Is there automated certificate renewal and rotation?
    *   **Why:** To ensure best practices for HTTPS security and compliance.

* * *

5\. **Security & Compliance**
-----------------------------

*   **How do you enforce security compliance for your workloads?**
    *   _Tools:_ Security Context Constraints (SCC), Pod Security Admission, Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper, NetworkPolicies, etc.
    *   _Follow-up:_ Are there any custom policies or exceptions?
    *   **Why:** To evaluate cluster security posture and risk.
*   **Are container images regularly scanned for vulnerabilities?**
    *   _Tools:_ Clair, Aqua Security, Prisma/Trivy, Sysdig, others?
    *   _Follow-up:_ What is the process if a vulnerability is detected?
    *   **Why:** Ensures you’re aware of possible attack vectors.

* * *

6\. **Monitoring & Logging**
----------------------------

*   **How do you monitor cluster health and application metrics?**
    *   _Tools:_ Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, OpenShift Monitoring?
    *   _Follow-up:_ What’s monitored (CPU, memory, network, custom app metrics)?
    *   **Why:** Good monitoring is critical for proactive support and alerting.
*   **How are application and cluster logs collected and analyzed?**
    *   _Solutions:_ EFK/ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana), Splunk, cloud logging (AWS/GCP/Azure), others?
    *   _Follow-up:_ Are logs retained long-term? Are there alerts on specific log patterns?
    *   **Why:** For root-cause analysis, compliance, and incident response.

* * *

7\. **Backup & Disaster Recovery (DR)**
---------------------------------------

*   **What is your current process for backup and disaster recovery?**
    *   _Tools:_ Velero, OADP, cloud snapshots, custom scripts?
    *   _Follow-up:_ Which resources are backed up (PV data, etcd, app configs)?
    *   **Why:** To assess recoverability in case of a disaster or data loss.
*   **When was the last time you tested your DR process?**
    *   _Was it successful? Any lessons learned?_
    *   **Why:** DR tests ensure backups are actually usable and identify any gaps before a real incident.

* * *

8\. **CI/CD Automation**
------------------------

*   **Which CI/CD tools are used for application deployments?**
    *   _Examples:_ Jenkins, Tekton, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, ArgoCD, others?
    *   _Follow-up:_ Is deployment fully automated, or are there manual approval steps?
    *   **Why:** Determines how much of the process is repeatable and auditable.

* * *

9\. **Performance & Troubleshooting**
-------------------------------------

*   **Have you experienced repeated performance issues or cluster instability?**
    *   _Examples:_ High CPU/memory pressure, pod restarts, etcd slowness, network drops?
    *   _Follow-up:_ Which workloads are most affected?
    *   **Why:** Helps prioritize support efforts and spot patterns.
*   **What troubleshooting methods and tools do you currently use?**
    *   _Tools/commands:_ oc debug, oc adm top, kube-state-metrics, etc.
    *   _Follow-up:_ Are there internal runbooks or preferred escalation paths?
    *   **Why:** To understand their current troubleshooting workflow and where L3 support can add value.

* * *

Bonus: **Open-Ended Final Question**
------------------------------------

*   **Is there anything else about your OpenShift environment or deployment practices that you feel we should be aware of for effective L3 support?**
    *   _Why:_ Opens up for anything unique or not covered above.

* * *

### **Tips:**

*   Adjust technical depth based on the audience.
*   Always ask for **examples** of incidents if they mention problems ("Can you share a recent case when this happened?").
*   Take note of tools/versions—they matter for L3 troubleshooting.

Let me know if you want a concise table or want to make it a client-facing questionnaire (for written form)!
