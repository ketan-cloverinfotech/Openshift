* * *

### Q4. How are your container images built and pushed to your registry?**
“Can you explain how you build and upload your application images (the files that run your apps)? For example, do you use tools like Jenkins, Tekton, or OpenShift’s own S2I (Source-to-Image) feature? Or do you build them manually?”

### Q7. **How do you do deployments?**

_“When you release a new version of your app, how do you deploy it in OpenShift? Is it done automatically through pipelines or do you do it manually?”_
