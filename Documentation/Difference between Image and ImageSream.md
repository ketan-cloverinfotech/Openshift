# Difference between Image and ImageStream in OpenShift
* * *

**1\. Image (Container Image)**
-------------------------------

An **Image** is a static file or snapshot containing an application along with everything it needs to run, such as code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime. Think of an image like a **DVD or USB drive** with software on it.

### **Real-world analogy:**

*   Imagine you buy software (like Microsoft Office) on a USB stick. The USB contains everything you need to install and run the software. Once created, that USB (image) doesnâ€™t change on its own.

* * *

**2\. ImageStream**
-------------------

An **ImageStream** is a feature specific to **OpenShift**. It's not a static image itself, but rather a reference or a pointer that tracks one or more images. It automatically detects updates to images and maintains a history of different versions. Think of an ImageStream as a **subscription service** (like Netflix or Spotify) that constantly updates you when something new is available.

### **Real-world analogy:**

*   Imagine you have a Netflix subscription. You don't own individual movies (images); instead, Netflix informs you whenever new movies or new versions of movies are available. This "notification system" and tracking is similar to how an ImageStream works.

* * *

**Practical Application Example:**
----------------------------------

Imagine you're developing a web application with Java:

### **Without ImageStream:**

*   You build a Docker Image (`myapp:v1`) with your Java application.
*   You deploy this image manually.
*   Every time you create a new version (e.g., `myapp:v2`), you must manually update your deployments to point to the new image tag.

This manual updating is similar to buying software DVDs. Each time a new version is released, you must manually obtain and install the new DVD.

### **With ImageStream (OpenShift way):**

*   You push your Docker Image (`myapp:v1`) to an ImageStream in OpenShift.
*   Your deployment points to the ImageStream instead of directly to an image.
*   When you push a new version (`myapp:v2`) to the ImageStream, OpenShift automatically notices this update.
*   You can configure OpenShift to automatically deploy the latest image from the ImageStream, without manual intervention.

This is like Netflix automatically giving you access to the latest episode of your favorite show without you having to manually search or update anything.

* * *

**Simple Summary:**
-------------------

| Container Image | ImageStream |
| --- | --- |
| Static file (like DVD/USB) | Dynamic reference (like Netflix account) |
| Does not change automatically | Automatically tracks changes/updates |
| Manually managed | Automatically managed and notified |
| Generic to all containers | Specific to OpenShift environment |

**Real Application Example in OpenShift:**
------------------------------------------

Imagine you're running a Node.js application in OpenShift:

1.  Build your application into an Image.
    ```
    docker build -t my-node-app:v1 .
    ```
2.  Push this Image to OpenShift ImageStream:
    ```
    oc import-image my-node-app:v1 --from=myregistry.com/my-node-app:v1 --confirm
    ```
3.  Now your Deployment points to this ImageStream:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: node-app
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: node-app
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: node-app
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: node-app
            image: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/myproject/my-node-app:latest
    ```

When you push a new version (`my-node-app:v2`) to the ImageStream, OpenShift automatically triggers the Deployment update if configured to track the latest tag.

* * *

In short:

*   **Image**: A single static package containing software.
*   **ImageStream**: A smart, automated pointer that tracks multiple images, helping you easily manage updates and versions.

That's the simplest way to understand Images and ImageStreams!
